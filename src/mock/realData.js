    title: "About Me",
    description: `I started as a Mechanical Engineering with passion for robotics. In my Bachelor, I made a fully autonomous Mobile Robot, then 
    In my Masters, I worked on Humanoid Robot Upper Body Control on Surena IV, Iran's National Robot.
    Finally, in my Ph.D., I entered the realm of Autonomous Vehicles, focusing on multi-sensor fusion
    for perception and localization. Now, I work for GM as AI Developer.`,
